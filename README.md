A SPP_net in pytorch framework which could be add to CNN arch freely.


SPP layer could be added in CNN model between convolutional layer and fully-connected lay, so that you can input multi-size images into your CNN model. 

The class **SPPLayer** in file **SPP_layer.py** is independent. It could be added in your own models.
